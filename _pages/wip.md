**Childcare and Social Norms (with Daniela Sonedda, Cristina Elisa Orso, and Matija Kovacic)  
This work in progress aims to explore how social norms from parental country of birth may impact family childcare decision. We will utilize several waves of European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data to perform the empirical analysis. 

**Inequality of Opportunity in Education: Exploring Indonesian Data with Regression Trees  
This work in progress is inspired from the paper titled The Roots of Inequality: Estimating Inequality of Opportunity from Regression Trees and Forests (Brunori et. al , 2023), in which the authors used regression trees and forest method on EU-SILC 2011 data to derive inequality of opportunity estimates with disposable household income as the outcome of interest. I am planning to use data from the 5th wave of Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS).
